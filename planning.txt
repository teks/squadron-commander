### i11
[v] use `ls` to show a ship when it needs orders:
    24h> mv ^0 28 56
    1 units need orders:
    <trek.trek.FriendlyShip alice Point(x=29.740456597169644, y=10.44552372684389)>
[ ] combat enrichment
    [v] morale:
        [v] set initial value: self.morale = 0.0 # neutral
        [v] depletion & restoration
        [v] effect on combat
        [v] write some tests
        [v] do playtest; fallout:
            [v] in `ls`, CV can have too many digits: CV=0.9875
    [ ] system damage
        [v] when there's hull damage, apply systems damage
            [v] Each system is subjected to a separate roll:
                * Chance of damage grows with hull damage fraction.
                * Severity of damage also grows with hull damage fraction.
                Each system is tracked separately as a fraction (1.0 = undamaged).
                The fraction tells how much performance is degrading.
        [ ] List of systems to damage and the effects of damage:
            [ ] Shields: Damage reduces maximum
            [ ] Warp Drive: Reduced speed and energy efficiency
            [ ] Tactical Systems: Reduced combat value
        [ ] write some tests
        [ ] do playtests
[v] `show <unit>...` to show system damage etc
    see `doc/object-detail-view.md`
[ ] `show <unit>` to show *effects* of system damage


Roadmap
=======
Complete Beta
(ux improvements as-needed, and):
[ ] system damage, see i11
[ ] ship repairs
[ ] force movement on retreat
    [ ] retreat moves using EMERGENCY SPEED
    [ ] Each ship's emergency warp value is used for this.
    [ ] Ships from a side tend to retreat in the same direction.
    [ ] order that toggles `ship.evasive` & retreat_check checks it
[ ] make some ship classes and experiment with combat outcomes
    for now symmetrically:
    [ ] go over numerical balance of ship values; see number-mull
    [ ] corvette (enemy: crow) <-- enemies are named after birds I guess
    [ ] cruiser (enemy: vulture)
[ ] playable scenario:
    [ ] enemies appear to the left, retreat to the left?
    [ ] new ones spawn periodically
[ ] additional ux as issues reveal themselves
    [ ] `ls a b c d` isn't an error
    [ ] `run 3` isn't an error but does NOT wait 3h and pause
    [ ] `show` defaulting to showing all units might be nice
    [ ] when there's a `:N` showing on a map, display its contents someplace
        every time there's a combat those `:N` displays show up, and
        the player needs good info on what `:N`; means


Backlog
=======

### ux & i9 playtesting feedback
[ ] refine ship's combat value further? (shields down, sys dmg?)
[ ] interception points:
    [ ] show interception point in `ls` when ATTACK
    [ ]? need a "show me the interception point" cmd
    [ ] show interception point when attack cmd is issued
[ ] add `<duration>` arg to `run` cmd
[ ] Message for interception
[ ] message for tick passage, maybe every 5 or 10? make it configurable
[ ] on each pause, give a report?
[ ] showing turn or tick number more often eg:
    [ ] show tick in prompt? eg `(+14h) ` or maybe `[0300] ` for 3 AM
    [ ] most messages should be prefixed with tick (in hours or walltime) eg:
        +13h ARRIVAL: ^2 baker has arrived at Point(x=32.0, y=32.0).
[ ] need a "tell me about the local area" command that
    lists everything in the area and gives status
    maybe a 'sitrep' cmd issues to a ship?
    this can provide info when units are stacked up eg `:3`
[ ] how much more time am I going to spend on a console game before switching
    to pygame or something?


### ops: repair & docking
[ ] raise morale to 0.0 by docking at a base and staying 24 hours, +0.1 for each 24h after

### misc
[ ] help facility?
[ ] `wait <unit> <duration>`  <-- add duration?

### low priority
[ ] mull a 'maneuverability' value for ships
[ ] look into non-flat probabilities:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#real-valued-distributions
[ ] raiders sometimes carry off hostages when they raid settlements?
    have to send ships to get them back? that implies boarding ops
[ ] attempt to use dataclasses for SpaceborneObject & children
