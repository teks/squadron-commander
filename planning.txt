## iteration 9
[v] space stations: starbases and space colonies; free-floating for now, not in orbit
[v] simplest AI for raiders: they attack nearest settlement
    AI action selection is last in the tick so the user can be aware of headings
[v] damage system for space stations; crib from Ship
[v] automated testing of i9 diff
[v] playtesting

## iteration 10
[v] why are enemies off the map?
[v] `status` command: by default show status of all units
[ ] pause simulation after each combat
[ ] revise combat report; it's hard to read

Future Iterations
=================

### ux & i9 playtesting feedback
[ ] show interception point in `ls` when ATTACK
[ ] `status <unit>...` to show status of chosen units
    see `doc/object-detail-view.md`
[ ] add `<duration>` arg to `run` cmd
[ ] Message for interception
[ ] message for tick passage, maybe every 5 or 10? make it configurable
[ ] on each pause, give a report?
[ ] showing turn or tick number more often eg:
    [ ] show tick in prompt? eg `(+14h) ` or maybe `[0300] ` for 3 AM
    [ ] most messages should be prefixed with tick (in hours or walltime) eg:
        +13h ARRIVAL: ^2 baker has arrived at Point(x=32.0, y=32.0).
[ ] need a "tell me about the local area" command that
    lists everything in the area and gives status
    maybe a 'sitrep' cmd issues to a ship?

### combat (descending priority):

[ ] force movement on retreat
  [ ] retreat moves using EMERGENCY SPEED
  [ ] Each ship's emergency warp value is used for this.
  [ ] Ships from a side tend to retreat in the same direction.
[ ] system damage
    [ ] on hull damage, apply systems damage
    [ ] add systems to ships
[ ] morale: depletion, restoration, and effect on combat
    set initial value: self.morale = 0.0 # neutral
[ ] refine ship's combat value (shields down, morale, etc)

[ ] make some ship classes and experiment with combat outcomes
    for now symmetrically:
    [ ] corvette (enemy: crow) <-- enemies are named after birds I guess
    [ ] cruiser (enemy: vulture)
[ ] mull a 'maneuverability' value for ships
[ ] order that toggles `ship.evasive` & retreat_check checks it
[ ] go over numerical balance of ship values; see number-mull

### misc
[ ] help facility?
[ ] `wait <unit> <duration>`  <-- add duration?

### low priority

[ ] look into non-flat probabilities:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#real-valued-distributions

[ ] raiders sometimes carry off hostages when they raid settlements?
    have to send ships to get them back? that implies boarding ops
[ ] attempt to use dataclasses for SpaceborneObject & children
