## iteration 9
[v] space stations: starbases and space colonies; free-floating for now, not in orbit
[v] simplest AI for raiders: they attack nearest settlement
    AI action selection is last in the tick so the user can be aware of headings
[v] damage system for space stations; crib from Ship
[v] automated testing of i9 diff
[v] playtesting

## iteration 10
[ ] why are enemies off the map?
	This is induced after running simulation for awhile; need better UX to observe problem

Future Iterations
=================
[ ] need a "tell me about the local area" command that
  lists everything in the area and gives status
  maybe a 'sitrep' cmd issues to a ship?

### i9 playtesting feedback
[ ] `status` command: by default show status of all units
    [ ] `status <unit>...` to show status of chosen units
[ ] `wait <unit>` command that assigns IDLE
[ ] Message when a raider chooses a new target
[ ] Message for interception
[ ] message for tick passage
[ ] pause simulation after each combat

### combat
[ ] force movement on retreat
  [ ] retreat moves using EMERGENCY SPEED
  [ ] Each ship's emergency warp value is used for this.
  [ ] Ships from a side tend to retreat in the same direction.

[ ] make some ship classes and experiment with combat outcomes
    for now symmetrically:
    [ ] corvette (enemy: crow) <-- enemies are named after birds I guess
    [ ] cruiser (enemy: vulture)
[ ] system damage
    [ ] on hull damage, apply systems damage
    [ ] add systems to ships
[ ] mull a 'maneuverability' value for ships
[ ] morale: depletion, restoration, and effect on combat
    set initial value: self.morale = 0.0 # neutral
[ ] refine ship's combat value (shields down, morale, etc)
[ ] order that toggles `ship.evasive` & retreat_check checks it
[ ] go over numerical balance of ship values; see number-mull

### misc
[ ] enemy ships:
    AI-driven enemy vessels' class should be child of Ship;
    enemies assign orders to themselves over time
[ ] attempt to use dataclasses for SpaceborneObject & children
[ ] concrete CLI ux class
    [ ] displays for various entities & the map
    [ ] help facility?

[ ] look into non-flat probabilities:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#real-valued-distributions

[ ] raiders sometimes carry off hostages when they raid settlements?
    have to send ships to get them back? that implies boarding ops
