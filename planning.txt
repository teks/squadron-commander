    https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#real-valued-distributions

### combat
[ ] system damage
    [ ] on hull damage, apply systems damage
    [ ] add systems to ships
[ ] mull a 'maneuverability' value for ships
[ ] morale: depletion, restoration, and effect on combat
    set initial value: self.morale = 0.0 # neutral
[ ] refine ship's combat value (shields down, morale, etc)
[ ] order that toggles `ship.evasive` & retreat_check checks it
[ ] go over numerical balance of ship values; see number-mull

### misc
[ ] enemy ships:
    AI-driven enemy vessels' class should be child of Ship;
    enemies assign orders to themselves over time
[ ] attempt to use dataclasses for SpaceborneObject & children
[ ] concrete CLI ux class
